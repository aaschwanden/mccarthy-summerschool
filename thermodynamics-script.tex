{\bf Note}: This script is largely based on the \emph{Physics of Glaciers I} lecture notes by Martin L\"uthi and Martin Funk, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, with additions from \cite{GreveBlatter_disg} and \cite{Gusmeroli2010}.

\vspace{1em}

Glaciers are divided into three categories, depending on their thermal
structure
%
\begin{description}
\item[Cold] The temperature of the ice is below the pressure melting temperature
 throughout the glacier, except for maybe a thin surface layer.
\item[Temperate] The whole glacier is at the pressure melting temperature, except
 for seasonal freezing of the surface layer.
\item[Polythermal] Some parts of the glacier are cold, some temperate.
 Usually the highest accumulation area, as well as the upper part of an ice
 column are cold, whereas the surface and the base are at melting
 temperature.
\end{description}
%
The knowledge of the distribution of temperature in glaciers and ice sheets is
of high practical interest
%
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0ex
\item A temperature profile from a cold glacier contains information on past
 climate conditions.
\item Ice deformation is strongly dependent on temperature (temperature
 dependence of the rate factor $A$ in Glen's flow law).
\item The routing of meltwater through a glacier is affected by ice
 temperature.  Cold ice is essentially impermeable, except for discrete
 cracks and channels.
\item If the temperature at the ice-bed contact is at the pressure melting
 temperature the glacier can slide over the base.
\item Wave velocities of radio and seismic signals are temperature
 dependent. This affects the interpretation of ice depth soundings.
\end{itemize}

The distribution of temperature in a glacier depends on many factors.  Heat
sources are on the glacier surface, at the glacier base and within the body of
the ice.  Heat is transported through a glacier by conduction (diffusion), is
advected with the moving ice, and is convected with water or air flowing
through cracks and channels.  Heat sources within the ice body are (Figure~\ref{fig:energy-sources})
%
\begin{itemize}\itemsep0ex
\item dissipative heat production (internal friction) due to ice deformation,
\item frictional heating at the glacier base (basal motion)
\item frictional heating of flowing water at englacial channel walls,
\item release or consumption of (latent) heat due to freezing and melting.
\end{itemize}
%
The importance of the processes depends on the climate regime a glacier is
subjected to, and also varies between different parts of the same glacier.


\section{Energy balance equation}
\label{sec:energy-balance}

The energy balance equation in the form suitable to calculate ice temperature
within a glacier is the advection-diffusion equation which in a spatially
fixed (Eulerian) reference frame is given by
%
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:heat-diffusion-advection}
 \rho\, c \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \nabla T\right) &=
 \nabla(k\nabla T) + P\,.\\[-3ex]
 \underbrace{\rule{5ex}{0ex}}_{\text{advection}} \; & \hspace{3ex}
 \underbrace{\rule{8ex}{0ex}}_{\text{diffusion}} \;
 \underbrace{\rule{5ex}{0ex}}_{\text{production}} \notag
\end{align}
%
The ice temperature $T(\mathbf{x},t)$ at location $\mathbf{x}$ and time $t$
changes due to advection, diffusion and production of heat.  The material
constants density $\rho$, specific heat capacity $c$ and thermal conductivity
$k$ are given in Table \ref{tab:thermal-properties}. In general, specific heat capacity and thermal heat conductivity are functions of temperature \citep[e.g.][]{Ritz1987},
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:specific-heat}
  c(T) = (146.3 + 7.253  T [\text{K}])\,\text{J}\,\text{kg}^{-1}\,\text{K}^{-1}
\end{equation} and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:heat-conductivity}
  k(T) = 9.828 e^{-0.0057 T [\text{K}]}\,\text{W}\,\text{m}^{-1}\,\text{K}^{-1}.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=7cm]{figures/k} \hfill

   \caption{Heat conductivity $k$ (left) and specific heat $c$ (right) for the temperature range from \cels{-50} until \cels{0}. After \cite{Ritz1987}.}
\end{figure}
%
For constant thermal conductivity $k$ and in one dimension (the vertical
direction $z$ and vertical velocity $w$) the energy balance equation
(\ref{eq:heat-diffusion-advection}) reduces to 
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:heat-diffusion-advection-1d}
 \rho\, c \left(\ddt{T} + w \ddz{T}\right) =
 k\, \frac{\partial^2T}{\partial z^2} + P.
\end{equation}

The heat production (source term) $P$ can be due to different processes (see Figure~\ref{fig:energy-sources}):\\[-1em]
%
\begin{description}
\item[Dissipation] In viscous flow the \emph{dissipation} \index{dissipation}
 due to ice deformation (heat release due to internal friction, often called strain heating) is
 $P=\mathrm{tr}({\bepsdot\bsigma})= \epsdot_{ij}\sigma_{ji}$, where $\bepsdot$ and $\bsigma$ are the strain rate tensor and the stress tensor, respecitively..  Because
 usually the shearing deformation dominates glacier flow
 \begin{equation*}
   P_{\text{def}} \simeq 2 \;\epsdot_{xz}\sigma_{xz}\,.
 \end{equation*} 
\item[Sliding friction] The heat production is the rate of loss of potential
 energy as an ice column of thickness $H$ moves down slope.  If all the
 frictional energy is released at the bed due to sliding with basal velocity
 $u_b$,
 \begin{equation*}
   P_{\text{friction}} =  \tau_bu_b \sim \rho g H  \tan\beta \, u_b \,,
 \end{equation*}
 where $\tau_b$  is basal shear stress and $\beta$ is
 the bed inclination.
\item[Refreezing of meltwater] Consider ice that contains a volume
 fraction $\omega$ of water. If a freezing front is moving with a velocity
 $v_\text{freeze}$ relative to the ice, the rate of latent heat production
 per unit area of the freezing front is
 \begin{equation*}
   P_{\text{freeze}} = v_\text{freeze} \,\omega \rho_w L.
 \end{equation*}

\section{Steady temperature profile}
\label{sec:steady-temp-profile}

The simplest case is a vertical steady state temperature profile
(Eq.~\ref{eq:heat-diffusion-advection-1d} without time derivative) in stagnant
ice ($w=0$) without any heat sources ($P=0$), and with constant thermal
conductivity $k$.  The heat flow equation
(\ref{eq:heat-diffusion-advection-1d}) then reduces to the diffusion equation
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:diffusion-1d}
 \frac{d\partial^2T}{\partial z^2} = 0.
\end{equation}
%
Integration with respect to $z$ gives
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:diffusion-1d-1int}
 \frac{dT}{d z} = Q := k G
\end{equation}
%
where $G = \nabla T$ is the (constant) temperature gradient. Integrating again
leads to
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:diffusion-1d-2int}
 T(z) = Q z + T(0) = kGz + T(0).
\end{equation}
%
Ice temperature changes linearly with depth.  Choosing for example a
temperature gradient of $G=1\unit{K}/ 100\unit{m} = 0.01\unit{K}\unit{m}^{-1}
= 10 \unit{mK}\unit{m}^{-1}$ gives a heat flux of $Q = kG = 0.021\unit{W}
\unit{m}^{-2} = 21\unit{mW} \unit{m}^{-2}$.  For comparison, typical
geothermal heat fluxes are $40- 120 \unit{mW} \unit{m}^{-2}$.

To transport a geothermal heat flux of $80 \unit{mW} \unit{m}^{-2}$ through a
glacier of $200\unit{m}$ thickness, the surface temperature has to be
$8\unit{K}$ lower than the temperature at the glacier base.

The above calculations (partly) explain why there can be water at the base of
the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.  Under an ice cover of $3000\unit{m}$
and at surface temperatures of \cels{-50} (in Antarctica), only a heat flux of
$Q=k \cdot 50\unit{K}/3000\unit{m}= 35\unit{mW}\unit{m}^{-2}$ can be
transported away.  Notice that horizontal and vertical advection change this
result considerably.


\section{Ice temperature close to the glacier surface}
\label{sec:ice-temp-surface}

The top $15\s{m}$ of a glacier (near surface layer, Figure~\ref{fig:energy-sources}) are subject to seasonal variations of
temperature. In this part of the glacier \emph{heat flow} (\emph{heat
 diffusion}) is dominant.  If we neglect advection we can rewrite Equation
(\ref{eq:heat-diffusion-advection-1d}) to obtain the well known \emph{Fourier
 law} of heat diffusion
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:heat-flow-1d}
  \ddt{T} = \kappa \, \frac{\partial^2T}{\partial h^2}
\end{equation}
%
where $h$ is depth below the surface, and $\kappa=k/(\rho C)$ is the
\emph{thermal diffusivity} of ice.  To calculate a temperature profile and
changes with time we need boundary conditions.  Periodically changing
boundary conditions at the surface such as day/night and winter/summer can be
approximated with a sine function.  At depth we assume a constant temperature
$T_0$
%
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:heat-flow-1d-bound}
  T(0,t)      &= T_0 + \Delta T_0 \cdot \sin(\omega t)\,,  \notag\\
  T(\infty,t) &= T_0\,.
\end{align}
%
$T_0$ is the mean surface temperature and $\Delta T_0$ is the amplitude of the
periodic changes of the surface temperature.  The duration of a period is
$2\pi/\omega$.  The solution of Equation (\ref{eq:heat-flow-1d}) with the
boundary condition (\ref{eq:heat-flow-1d-bound}) is
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:heat-flow-1d-solution}
  T(h,t) = T_0 + \Delta T_0 \exp\left(-h \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2\kappa}}\right)
           \sin\left(\omega t - h \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2\kappa}}\right).
\end{equation}
%
The solution is plotted for realistic values of $T_0$ and $\Delta T$ on Colle
Gnifetti ($4550\unit{m} \unit{a.s.l.}$, Monte Rosa, Valais).  Notice that full
ice density has been assumed for the plot, instead of a firn layer with
strongly changing thermal properties, and vertical advection is neglected.
%

 \caption{Variation of temperature with depth for the conditions at Colle
   Gnifetti.  Numbers next to curves indicate months (1 corresponds to January). }
 \label{fig:water}
\end{figure}

The solution (Eq.~\ref{eq:heat-flow-1d-solution}) has some noteworthy
properties
%
\begin{itemize}
\item[a)] The amplitude varies with depth $h$ as
%
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:temp-depth-amplitude}
   \Delta T(h) = \Delta T_0 \exp\left(-h \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2\kappa}}\right)
 \end{equation}
\item[b)] The temperature $T(h,t)$ has an extremum when
 \begin{equation*}
   \sin\left(\omega t - h \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2\kappa}}\right) = \pm 1 \qquad
   \Rightarrow \qquad \omega t - h \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2\kappa}} = \frac{\pi}{2}
 \end{equation*}
 and therefore
 \begin{equation}
   \label{eq:temp-depth-maximum}
   t_{\textrm{max}} = \frac{1}{\omega}\left(
     \frac{\pi}{2} + h \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2\kappa}} \right)
 \end{equation}
 The phase shift is increasing with depth below the surface.
\item[c)] The heat flux $G(h,t)$ in a certain depth $h$ below the surface is
%
 \begin{equation*}
   G(h,t) = -k\frac{\partial T}{\partial h} = %\cdots \quad
   \text{\small (complicated formula that is easy to derive)}
 \end{equation*}
%
 For the heat flux $G(0,t)$ at the glacier surface we get
 \begin{equation*}
   G(0,t) = \Delta T_0 \sqrt{\omega \rho\, c\,k}\, \sin\left(\omega t + \frac{\pi}{4}\right)
 \end{equation*}
%
 $G(0,t)$ is maximal when
%
 \begin{align*}
   \sin\left(\omega t + \frac{\pi}{4}\right)=1 \qquad\Rightarrow \qquad
   \omega t + \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2} \qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad
   t_{\text{max}} = \frac{\pi}{4\omega}
 \end{align*}
%
 where $t_{\text{max}}$ is the time when the heat flux at the glacier surface
 is maximum.
%
\begin{align*}
 &\text{Temperature:}&  t_{\textrm{max}}&= \frac{\pi}{2\omega}\\
 &\text{Heat flux:} &  t_{\textrm{max}} &= \frac{\pi}{4\omega}
\end{align*}
%
The difference is $\pi/(4\omega)$ and thus $1/8$ of the period.  The maximum
heat flux at the glacier surface is $1/8$ of the period ahead of the maximum
temperature.  For a yearly cycle this corresponds to 1.5 months.
\item[d)]  From the ratio between the amplitudes in two different depths the
 heat diffusivity $\kappa$ can be calculated
 \begin{align*}
   \frac{\Delta T_2}{\Delta T_1} = \exp \left( (h_1-h_2)
     \sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2\kappa}} \right)
   \qquad\Longrightarrow \qquad
   \kappa = \frac{\omega}{2} \left(\frac{h_2-h_1}{\ln 
          \frac{\Delta T_2}{\Delta T_1}}\right)^2
  \end{align*}
\end{itemize}

There are, however, some restrictions to the idealized picture given above
%
\begin{itemize}
\item The surface layers are often not homogeneous.  In the accumulation area
 density is increasing with depth. Conductivity $k$ and diffusivity $\kappa$
 are functions of density (and also temperature).
\item In nature the surface boundary condition is not a perfect sine function.
\item The ice is moving.  Heat diffusion is only one part, heat advection may
 be equally important.
\item Percolating and refreezing melt water can drastically change the picture
 by providing a source of latent heat (see below).
\end{itemize}
%
Superimposed on the yearly cycle are long term temperature changes at the
glacier surface.  These penetrate much deeper into the ice, as can be seen
from Equation (\ref{eq:temp-depth-amplitude}), since $\omega$ decreases for
increasing forcing periods.

In spring or in high accumulation areas the surface layer of a glacier
consists of snow or firn.  If surface melting takes place, the water
percolates into the snow or firn pack and freezes when it reaches a cold
layer.  The freezing of $1\unit{g}$ of water releases sufficient heat to raise
the temperature of $160\unit{g}$ of snow by $1\unit{K}$.  This process is
important to ``annihilate'' the winter cold from the snow or firn cover in
spring, and is the most important process altering the thermal structure of
high accumulation areas and of the polar ice sheets.

\section{Temperate glaciers}
\label{sec:temperate-glaciers}

Liquid water, generated from melting snow or direct input from rainfall, is routed down{-}glacier by supraglacial streams. When such streams intersect vertical shafts (moulins), crevasses or fractures, water can enter the macroscopic englacial water system (MWS, Figure~\ref{fig:mws}a) mainly formed by a network of decimeter size, hydraulically connected fractures which can route macroscopic volumes of water to the bed of the glacier \citep{FountainWalder1998,Fountain2005}.
%

Water in glaciers occurs also in a fundamentally different system unconnected from MWS: the microscopic water system (mWS, Figure~\ref{fig:mws}b). mWS is formed by small ($\mu m$) water inclusions found in veins along three grain intersections, lenses on grain boundaries and in irregular shapes \citep{RaymondHarrison1975,Nye1989,Mader1992,FountainWalder1998}. Such water inclusions are primarily generated in the accumulation area where meltwater percolates in the porous firn and become part of the glacier-ice crystalline structure when pores closed for compaction \citep{Paterson1971,Lliboutry1976,Pettersson2004}.


In a temperate glacier, all heat that is produced at the boundaries or within
the glacier is used to melt ice. This meltwater then becomes part of mWS. The water content, however, is small, usually
between 0.1 and 4 volume percent.  The water is stored in veins and triple
junctions between the ice grains, where it can slowly percolate through the
ice matrix if veins are not blocked by air bubbles.  The water between ice
grains has an important effect on the deformation properties of ice, and it
affects the rate factor $A$ in Glen's flow law \citep{Duval1977,Paterson1994}
%
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:ratefactor-water}
 A(\omega) &= (3.2 + 5.8 \omega) \cdot 10^{-15} \unit{kPa}^{-3}\unit{s}^{-1}
 \notag\\
 &= (101 + 183\omega) \unit{MPa}^{-3}\unit{a}^{-1}\,,
\end{align}
%
where $\omega$ is the percentage of water within the ice (also called moisture content or liquid water fraction).
%
Temperate glacier ice is a mixture of ice ($97-99\unit{\%}$), water
($1-3\unit{\%}$), and small amounts of air and minerals.  For pure ice the
melting temperature $T_m$ depends on absolute pressure $p$ by
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:clausius-pure}
 T_m = T_{tp} - \gamma\, (p - p_{\text{tp}})\,,
\end{equation}
% 
where $T_{tp}=273.16\unit{K}$ and $p_{tp}=611.73\unit{Pa}$ are the triple
point temperature and pressure of water.  The Clausius-Clapeyron constant is
$\gamma_{p}= 7.42 \cdot 10^{-5} \unit{K}\unit{kPa}^{-1}$ for pure water/ice.
Since glacier ice is not pure, the value of $\gamma$ can be as high as
$\gamma_a = 9.8 \cdot 10^{-5} \unit{K}\unit{kPa}^{-1}$ for air saturated water
\citep{Harrison1975a}.

% The melting temperature temperature can vary quite rapidly due to changing water
% pressure.  An example from a borehole in Gornergletscher is shown in Figure
% \ref{fig:druck-temperatur-gorner}.

\section{Cold glaciers}
\label{sec:cold-glaciers}

In cold glaciers heat flow is driven by temperature gradients.  Usually the
base is warmest due to dissipation, friction and geothermal heat.  This has
the consequence that heat is flowing from the base into the ice body, warming
up the ice.  Advection of warm or cold ice strongly influences local ice
temperature. Cold glaciers exist in the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antartica and at high altitudes at lower latitudes. 

In the Alps, for example, cold glaciers were observed at altitudes above $3900\unit{m}\unit{a.s.l.}$.  The most famous of these is Colle
Gnifetti ($4550 \unit{m}\unit{a.s.l.}$), the highest accumulation basin of the
Gorner-/Grenzletscher system.  At temperatures of about \cels{-13} the ice
conserves atmospheric conditions such as impurities and air bubbles.  Surface
melting only takes place on exceptionally hot days and leads to formation of
ice lenses.  Many ice cores have been drilled on Colle Gnifetti and were
investigated in the laboratory to obtain the climate history of central Europe.

Figure \ref{fig:colle-profiles} shows two temperature profiles measured in
boreholes $200\unit{m}$ apart on the same flow line on Colle Gnifetti.  In the
absence of advection and density gradients, one would expect straight steady
state temperature profiles.  The unequal curvature of the modeled steady state
profiles (Fig.~\ref{fig:colle-profiles}a) is due to firn
density and different advection regimes.  This shows that the interpretation
of temperature profiles to deduce past climate can be quite tricky.

The marked bend towards warmer temperature at $30\unit{m}$ depth is due to
changing surface temperatures.  Numerical modeling showed that the temperature
increase by \cels{1} around 1990 is mainly responsible for this feature (the
profiles were measured in 1995/96; in 1982 the transient profiles looked like
the steady state configuration).

   the measured heat flux at the glacier base.  From \cite{LuethiFunk2001}.}
 \label{fig:colle-moutain}
\end{figure}


Modeling the advection and conduction of heat in a glacier is usually not
sufficient.  The geothermal heat flux close to the glacier base is affected by
the ice temperature, and therefore by the glacier flow, and the flux of
meltwater.  Figure~\ref{fig:colle-moutain} shows
the temperature distribution in whole massif, with the glacier on top.  Notice
that there are areas within the mountain where heat flows horizontally (heat
always flows perpendicular to the isotherms).  Heat flux at sea level was
assumed to be $70\unit{mW}\unit{m}^{-2}$, but it had to be greatly reduced to
match the observed fluxes.  In the model this was accomplished with
freezing/thawing ice within the rock (permafrost), which is a reaction to
climate changes since the last ice age.  The lowest calculated permafrost
margin was at about $2900\unit{m}$ elevation.



\section{Polythermal glaciers and ice sheets}
\label{sec:polythermal-glaciers}

Polythermal glaciers occur in different climates and at different geographic locations. Given the winter cooling of the surface layer in temperate glaciers, or the summer warming of the surface layer in cold glaciers, most glaciers are seasonally polythermal. The only exceptions are perhaps cold glaciers in the extremely cold climate of Antarctica. Considering only perennial polythermal glaciers, the most frequent structures are the so-called Scandinavian-type and Canadian-type polythermal glaciers (Figure~\ref{fig:thermal-structures}).

\begin{figure}
  \begin{centering}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/CTSstructures-2land}
  \caption{Longitudinal section of glaciers with (a) Canadian-type and (b) Scandinavian-type polythermal structures.}
  \label{fig:thermal-structures}
  \end{centering}
\end{figure}

The Scandinavian type occurs in Svalbard \citep{Bamber1988,Jania1996}, Scandinavia \citep{HolmlundEriksson1989}, the Rocky Mountains \citep{Paterson1971}, Alaska and the Antarctic Peninsula \citep{Breuer2006}. Such glaciers are mostly temperate except for a cold surface layer in the ablation zone. This seemingly paradoxical situation may be explained by the summer heat input, which is stored due to percolation of meltwater into the upper firn area, whereas this heat is lost due to runoff of meltwater over the impermeable surface ice in the ablation zone (Figure~\ref{fig:scandinavian-structure}). If winter temperatures increase, the cold layer thins and may eventually disappear, leaving an entirely temperate glacier.

   \caption{Scandinavian-type polythermal structure. Most of the ice is temperate (gray color) except for a cold near-surface layer in the ablation zone.

   \label{fig:scandinavian-structure}
 \end{figure}

%
The Canadian type occurs at high Arctic latitudes in Canada \citep{Blatter1987,Blatter1988} and Alaska, but the large ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica also show this polythermal structure locally. Canadian-type glaciers are mostly cold except for a temperate layer at the bed in the ablation zone. The temperate layer at the bedrock can be of considerable thickness and is due to geothermal heat flux and heat dissipation due to friction and ice deformation.  The latter is highest close to the base because stresses and strain rates are highest there.  Depending on the climate, ice thickness and ice flow, the thickness of this basal layer may shrink to zero, leaving a so-called basal hot spot \citep{Classen1971}. There may be additional polythermal structures, such as combinations of the above if glaciers span an extreme altitude range, or at confluences of glaciers with different thermal structures \citep{Eisen2009}.


Gorner-/Grenzgletscher is the biggest polythermal glacier in the Alps.  Cold
ice originating from Colle Gnifetti is advected down to the confluence area at
$2500\unit{m}\unit{a.s.l.}$, and all the way to the glacier tongue.  Figure
\ref{fig:temp-profile-gorner} shows the slow cooling of a borehole in the
confluence area after hot-water drilling.  The cold ice is mostly impermeable
to water which leads to the formation of deeply incised river systems and
surficial lakes which sometimes drain through crevasses or \emph{moulins}.

   \label{fig:temp-profile-gorner}}
\end{figure}

Polythermal glaciers are usually cold in their core and temperate close to the
surface and at the bedrock.  Heat sources at the surface are from the air
(sensible heat flux), direct solar radiation (short wave), thermal radiation
(long wave), and the penetration and refreezing of melt water (convection and
latent heat).  

Nice examples of the polythermal structure of the Greenland ice sheet are the
temperature profiles in Figure \ref{fig:jako-temp-profiles}, measured in
Jakobshavn Isbr\ae{}, Greenland
\citep{IkenEchelmeyer1993,Funk1994a,Luethi2002}.  The drill
sites are located $50\unit{km}$ inland of the margin of the Greenland ice
sheet, at a surface elevation is $1100\unit{m} \unit{a.s.l.}$, where ice
thickness on the ice sheet is $830\unit{m}$, but about $2500\unit{m}$ in the
ice stream center.

\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:jako-temp-profiles} (bottom left) temperatures are highest
close to the surface and close to the bed. The thick, very cold layer in
between is advected from the inland parts of the ice sheet (see Figure
\ref{fig:jako-temp-model} top).  The lowest $31\unit{m}$ are at the pressure
melting temperature $T_m = \cels{-0.55}$.  A quick calculation with Equation
(\ref{eq:clausius-pure}), and reasonable values for the ice density and gravity
gives
%
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:jako-melting-point}
 T_m&= T_{tp} - \gamma_p (p - p_{\text{tp}}) = T_p - \gamma_{p} (\rho g H -
 p_{tp}) \notag\\
 &= 273.16 \unit{K} - 7.42 \cdot 10^{-5} \unit{K}\unit{kPa}^{-1} \left(
   900\unit{kg}\unit{m}^3 \cdot 9.825\unit{m}\unit{s}^{-2}\cdot 830\unit{m}
 \right) \notag\\
 &\simeq 273.16 \unit{K} - 0.545\unit{K} \simeq 272.615 \unit{K} = \cels{-0.54}\,.
\end{align}
%
The strong curvature of the temperature profiles where they are coldest
indicates that the ice is warming.  Upward heat flux from the temperate zone
close to the base is very high.  The temperature gradient just above the CTS
($800\unit{m}$ depth) in profile D is $0.048\unit{K}\unit{m}^{-1}$. The upward
heat flux therefore is (per unit area)
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:jako-heat-flux}
 Q \;=\; k \,\ddz{T} \;\simeq\;2.1 \unit{W}\unit{m}^{-1}\unit{K}^{-1} \cdot 0.048
 \unit{K}\unit{m}^{-1} \;\simeq\; 0.1\unit{W}\unit{m}^{-2}\,.
\end{equation}
%
This heat has to be produced locally, since heat fluxes in the temperate zone
below $800\unit{m}$ depth are downward (away from the CTS), but very small due
to the Clausius-Clapeyron temperature gradient.  The only way to produce this
heat is by freezing the water contained within the temperate ice.  From a flow
model we know that the CTS moves with respect to the ice by $v_\text{freeze}
\sim 1 \unit{m}\unit{a}^{-1}$.  With a moisture content of $\omega = 1\unit{\%}$
(by volume) we obtain a heat production rate of
%
\begin{align}
 \label{eq:jako-heat-production-cts}
 P &= \omega\,v_\text{freeze}\, \rho_w L \;\simeq \; 0.01 \cdot 1 \unit{m}\unit{a}^{-1} \cdot
 1000 \unit{kg}\unit{m}^3 \cdot 3.33\cdot 10^5\unit{J}\unit{kg}^{-1} \notag\\
   &= 3.55 \unit{MJ}\unit{a}^{-1}\unit{m}^{-3} \simeq 0.113 \unit{W}\unit{m}^{-3}
\end{align}
% 
which matches up nicely with the heat transported away by diffusion
(Eq.~\ref{eq:jako-heat-flux}).  A detailed analysis with the flow model shows
that the most likely value for the water content is about $1.5\unit{\%}$
(Fig.~\ref{fig:jako-temp-model}, bottom right).  Another interesting result
form the model is that an ice column passing through drill site D has already
lost the lowest $40\unit{m}$ through melting at the glacier base.


\section{Advection -- diffusion}
\label{sec:advection-diffusion}

Close to the ice divides in the central parts of an ice sheet, the ice
velocity is mainly vertical down.  Under the assumptions of only vertical
advection, no heat generation, and a frozen base we can calculate the steady
state temperature profile with the simplified Equation
(\ref{eq:heat-diffusion-advection-1d})
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:heat-diffusion-advection-1d-steady}
 \kappa \frac{d^2T}{d z^2} =  w(z) \frac{d T}{d z}
\end{equation}
%
The boundary conditions are
\begin{align*}
 \text{surface:} \qquad & z=H: &\qquad \text{temperature}\;T_s = \text{const}\\
 \text{bedrock:} \qquad & z=0: &\qquad \text{heat flux}\;-k \left(\frac{dT}{dz}\right)_{B} = G
 = \text{const}
\end{align*}
%
For the first integration we substitute $f = \frac{dT}{dz}$ so that $\kappa f'
= wf \; \Longrightarrow \; \frac{f' }{f} = \frac{1}{\kappa} w$ with the
solution
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:8}
 \frac{dT(z)}{dz} = \left(\frac{dT}{dz}\right)_{B}  \exp \left( \frac{1}{\kappa} \int_0^z w(z)\, dz \right)\,.
\end{equation}
%
Now we make the assumption that the vertical velocity is $w(z) = -b z/H$, with
the vertical velocity at the surface equal to the net mass balance rate $w_{s}
= -\dot{b}$.  With the definition $l^2 := 2\kappa H /\dot{b}$ we get
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:10}
 T(z) - T(0) = \left(\frac{dT}{dz}\right)_{B}  \int_0^z \exp \left(-\frac{z^2}{l^2}   \right) \,dz
\end{equation}
%
which has the solution
%
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:11}
 T(z) - T_s = \frac{\sqrt\pi}{2} l \left(\frac{dT}{dz}\right)_{B} 
 \left[ {\textrm{erf}} \left( \frac{z}{l} \right) - {\textrm{erf}} \left( \frac{H}{l} \right) \right]\,.
\end{equation}
%
The so-called \emph{error function} is tabulated and implemented in any
mathematical software (usually as \texttt{erf}), and is defined as
%
\begin{equation*}
 \label{eq:12}
 {\textrm{erf}}(x) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^x \exp(-x^2) \, dx.
\end{equation*}

We now introduce the useful definition of the \emph{P{\'e}clet Number} $\text{Pe}
= w H/\kappa$ which is a measure of the relative importance of advection
and diffusion.  The shape of the temperature profiles in Figure
\ref{fig:advection-diffusion} only depends on the P{\'e}clet Number.  Depth and
temperature can be scaled by the dimensionless variables
%
\begin{align*}
 &\text{scaled distance above bed} & \xi &= \frac{z}{H}\,,\\
 &\text{scaled temperature}        & \Theta &= \frac{k (T-T_s)}{G H}\,.\\
\end{align*}
%

    dimensionless variables $\xi$ and $\Theta$ for various values of the
